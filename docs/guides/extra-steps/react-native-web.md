# React Native Web

The [react-native-webrtc-web-shim](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc-web-shim) project provides a shim for [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) support.  
  
That will allow you to use ["almost"](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc-web-shim/tree/main#setup) the exact same code in your mixed web project as you would with [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) directly.
