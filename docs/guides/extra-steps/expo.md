# Expo 45+

Sadly this module is not currently available in the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app by default due to including much needed native code.  
  
However you can get things working via the [expo-dev-client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/) library and out-of-tree [config-plugins/react-native-webrtc](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins/tree/main/packages/react-native-webrtc) package.
