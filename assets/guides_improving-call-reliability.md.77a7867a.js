There is a good reason for having a NAT, like for example the IPv4 limitations where there can only be around 4.29 billion addresses and as new devices are being created all the time it makes sense to throw them over smaller amounts of Public IP Addresses rather than giving them one each.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-stun-server-and-why-do-i-need-it" tabindex="-1">What is a STUN server and why do i need it? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-stun-server-and-why-do-i-need-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) is a protocol that helps devices behind a NAT connect outside of the local network.</p><p>The STUN server enables devices to find out what their public IP Address is, the type of NAT they are behind and also the accessible public port associated with the device behind the NAT.</p><p>Once that information has been gathered tests can take place to determine if data can be routed to the device directly without restriction.
