# The React-Native-WebRTC Handbook

This is The React-Native-WebRTC Handbook.  
It's powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).  
NOTE: Nodejs >= 16 is necessary.  

## Building the site

The site is built automatically with every push thanks to a [GH Actions](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/handbook/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml).  
If you want to build it locally, follow this simple step:  

```js
yarn && yarn start
```

You can now edit the files in the `docs` folder and the site will reflect the changes immediately thanks to live reloading.
