# The React-Native-WebRTC Handbook

Powered by [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).  
`Nodejs >= 16 is necessary.`  
Built automatically with every push thanks to [GH Actions](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/handbook/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml).  

## Want to build and run our handbook locally?

Say no more. It's as simple as running one of the following lines.  
Entirely depends on your preferred package manager.

```
npm install && npm start
yarn && yarn start
pnpm install && pnpm start
```

You can now edit the files in the `src` folder and the site should start to reflect any changes you make thanks to live reloading.
